Designed with each element of the HP printing process in mind, HP papers, toners, and inks are specially engineered to work together to deliver quality, reliable printing, as well as fade resistance, bolder blacks and more vibrant colors.Because HP papers are specifically formulated to work with HP printers, it's important to select the right HP paper for every job to ensure a crisp, clean finished product.Key HP Paper FeaturesCheck the label on HP paper packaging to find this key information:FinishConsider the look you want to achieve, and choose a finish that fits your needs:Glossy:For color images that really pop, try printing on a paper with a glossy finish.Matte:If printing a document with text, such as a term paper or resume, a matte finish can make your text easier to read.Satin:A satin finish will give your photos a smooth, professional touch.BrightnessThe brightness of your paper refers to the amount of light reflected from the surface of the paper, and is typically measured on a scale from 1 to 100. Print on brighter paper, such as HP Bright White Inkjet Paper, for higher contrast, crisper text, and a clean background for more vivid images.WeightThickness (measured in millimeters) and weight (measured in pounds), refer to the sturdiness and crease-resistance of your paper. HP paper comes in a variety of different weights.You may try using a heavier paper for artwork or pieces that will be frequently handled, like cards or brochures.

So how do you know which tape is right for you?There are a number of factors to  consider when choosing the right packaging tape:Note theweightof your package. The heavier the  package, the thicker the tape should be.Consider how the package is going to beshipped. If the package is travelling a long distance,  or will be handled by many people, choose one with higher tensile strength and  percent elongation, so the box stays closed even if dropped.Examine your shippingcontainer. While general  use tapes work well on popular single wall corrugated cardboard containers and  regular slotted containers (RSC), more and more cardboard boxes have higher  recycled content. This recycled corrugate content, as well as corrugate with  double or triple walls, needs a tape with an adhesive designed specifically for  this recycled content. Further, it needs a high adhesion to ensure the box  sticks securely and stays sealed throughout the shipping chain.About 3M&#x2122; Industrial Adhesives and TapesFor more than a century, 3M has applied innovation and  technology to improving our customers&rsquo; lives and supporting their business  goals.

        "description": "Scotch&#xAE; High Performance Masking Tape 232 produces sharp paint lines in medium temperature paint bake operations and provides clean removal, even on difficult to remove from surfaces. The thick crepe paper backing contains a solvent-resistant saturant that helps resist paint bleed-through against latex and oil-based paints. This tape offers moderate conformability for masking around corners and over irregular surfaces. The rubber adhesive sticks instantly, offer strong holding power that resists lifting, curling, and adhesive transfer when removing from surfaces like EDPM rubber moldings. This tape performs well in paint bake operations at temperatures up to 250&#xB0; F/ 121&#xB0; C for up to 30 minutes to create sharp, professional paint lines. Tests indicate it is better than conventional masking tapes for sunlight resistance; however it is advised that the tape not be subjected to outdoor exposure or prolonged periods of sunlight as it may become difficult to remove. This tape delivers superior performance as a paint masking tape and is also useful for holding, protecting, bundling and a vast number of other difficult jobs where a pressure sensitive tape is needed. This durable tape can be certified for ASTM D-6123.Uncommon VersatilityThe crepe paper backing tears easily, offers moderate conformability around corners and over irregular surfaces, and lifts off cleanly. The natural rubber adhesive bonds well to paper, metal, drywall, wood, and painted surfaces with reliable holding power and conformability. Under normal operating conditions Scotch&#xAE; High Performance Masking Tape 232 features one piece removal and is sliver resistant.Product InformationAdhesion to Steel37 oz./in. width (41 N/100 mm)Tensile Strength27 lbs./in. width (472 N/100 mm)Elongation at Break8&#37;Tape Thickness6.3 mils/ 0.16 mm;Temperature Use RangeUp to 250&#xB0; F/ 121&#xB0;C for 30 minWhat is Masking Tape?Masking tape was developed specifically to help protect surrounding surfaces from overspray, provide clean paint lines, and remove easily and cleanly when finished. The backing, typically crepe paper, sticks when applied to curved and irregular surfaces without lifting or curling. Various masking tapes are designed for different applications and should be removed within their specified time range. A very thin or poorly manufactured tape may splinter or shred when coming off the roll or being removed after use. Masking tapes from 3M adhere well, resist solvents or water from the paint, and are strong enough to hang plastic sheeting, yet remove cleanly without damaging the subsurface. These products hand tear for tool-free application. Some have sufficient tensile strength for light commercial and industrial applications, making them useful for bundling, labeling, sealing, temporary repairs, lane marking, splicing, and surface protection. The classic crepe paper masking tape is a light tan color, but masking tapes from 3M come in a variety of other colors and formulations to meet general and specific applications. It should be noted that many crepe paper masking tapes perform best for indoor purposes and may be difficult to remove after exposure to sunlight. Many of these tapes also have a shelf life of 12 months, beyond which, peak performance cannot be assured. A roll of masking tape is a basic toolbox or supply room item in any construction, warehousing, military, marine, shipping, or retail industry.About 3M Industrial Adhesives and TapesFor more than a century, 3M has applied innovation and technology to improving our customers&#x2019; lives and supporting their business goals.

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the &quot;MPG&quot; ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsSave time&mdash; with the world's fastest all-in-one1Speed through critical documents&mdash; ISO print speeds of 15 ISO ppm (black) and 7.2 ISO ppm (color)&dagger;Print twice as much&mdash; get about 2x more prints with 127 Extra High-capacity Black ink cartridges2Individual ink cartridges&mdash; replace only the color you needLess hassle&mdash; built-in 250-sheet paper tray means you re-load paper less oftenDo more&mdash; 30-page Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of originalsEasy wireless printing&mdash; built-in Easy Epson Wi-Fi makes wireless setup, networking and printing fast and easy3PC-Fax&mdash; fax documents directly from your computer6Front USB port&mdash; insert thumb drive and upload files directly to your PCHigh-speed faxing in black and color&mdash; as fast as 3 sec per page; speed dial storage up to 60 numbers; fax memory up to 180 pagesProtect important documents&mdash; smudge, fade and water resistant prints; documents rival those from a laser printerSave energy&mdash; uses up to 70% less power than laser printers4Product protection you can count on&mdash; one-year limited warranty; phone support, without charge, for the life of the product7; plus, get free templates and \"how to\" tutorialsPackaging Specifications (W x D x H)&mdash; Dimensions: Printing 17.6&quot; x 21.9&quot; x 9.1&quot;, Storage 17.6&quot; x 14.2&quot; x 8.9&quot; and Weight 16.8 lb.Eco featuresUses up to 70% less power than laser printers4Save up to 50% on paper with manual, two-sided printing5ENERGY STAR&reg;qualifiedDesigned to be Recycled8Epson America, Inc. is a SmarWaySMTransport Partner9Epson Ink Supplies126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Black ink cartridge (T126120)126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Cyan ink cartridge (T126220)126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Magenta ink cartridge (T126320)126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Yellow ink cartridge (T126420)126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Color Multipack (CMY) (T126520)Epson Paper SuppliesPremium Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 50 sheets (S041257)Bright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586)Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331)Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)What&rsquo;s in the BoxWorkForce 630 All-in-OneInstruction manualCD-ROM with drivers and bonus softwareFree sample paper packPower cordTelephone cordFour DURABrite Ultra Ink cartridges (four 126-series High-capacity ink cartridges: Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)&dagger;What is ISO ppm?ISO ppm is based on the new international standard for measuring print speed.

Redington and William H. Sanford, Jr., the Sharpie Fine Point marker hit the market in 1964. It quickly became known as the first pen-style permanent marker that could write on almost any surface--from glass, wood and stone, to plastic, metal and, of course, paper. Endorsed by celebrities like NBC talk show hosts Johnny Carson and Jack Parr, the Sharpie marker quickly gained prominence.In the late nineties and early 2000s, the company introduced Sharpie markers in a variety of new, fun colors, including aqua, berry, turquoise and lime. By the end of 2002, over 200 million Sharpie markers had been produced, enough for approximately two Sharpie markers for every household in America!",

This replacement toner cartridge is made in the USA from new and recycled components. It is neither sponsored nor endorsed by Brother. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.By using this remanufactured product, you are reducing the amount of waste being deposited into landfills. Instead of using a newly manufactured toner, by purchasing this remanufactured version you are participating in the highest form of recycling: re-use. While not every component within the toner can be reused, we do re-use those components that meet our quality standards and replace the rest with new quality components.Environmental stewardship is an important practice, and our goal is to re-use as many of the components as possible without degrading product performance. When the cartridges are no longer remanufacturable, or components no longer adhere to our quality specifications, the components will be disposed off. For example, the metals will be stripped from the cartridge body and sent to a local recycler, the plastics are sent for conversion to waste energy, and corrugate box materials are locally recycled. We also use electro-coagulation to treat manufacturing waste water, use degradable black bags to protect sensitive cartridge components during shipping, and our facility recycles cans, bottles and paper products.STMC--Certified for Quality and ValueOur manufacturer's dedication to developing and following documented practices has earned them STMC (Standardized Test Methods Committee) certification for their testing practices.Every toner cartridge begins with a thorough inspection process to ensure only those cartridges that can be returned to full functionality are used. We use technicians that are trained not just on the equipment they operate, but on the processes and procedures required to produce a quality, value cartridge.First, the technicians disassemble the cartridges to inspect each critical wear component to determine if it should be re-used or replaced. The cartridge is then moved to the filling operation where precision machinery deposits toner formulated for the specific cartridge type. Before shipping, the cartridge is tested to confirm that it works correctly.When you receive your new AmazonBasics remanufactured replacement toner cartridge, if you'd like to recycle your used toner cartridge, from any manufacturer, simply go to the helpful hints on this page for recycling instructions.AmazonBasics: Quality Products at Low PricesAmazonBasics is a collection of consumer electronic \"basics\" created by combining quality and low prices for an overall focus on value.Amazon Frustration-Free PackagingThis AmazonBasics product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging that is recyclable.

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the &quot;MPG&quot; ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsSmart, 7.8&quot; touch panel&mdash; large display lights up only the buttons you need; includes a 3.5&quot; LCD to preview, edit and print photosBuilt&ndash;in Wi&ndash;Fi, plus Ethernet, networking&mdash; print, scan, and access memory card slots1from any room in the house with built&ndash;in wireless and wired networkingUltra Hi&ndash;Definition prints&mdash; brilliant 4&quot; x 6&quot; photos in as fast as 10 seconds; DX5MicroPiezo technology provides the finest color and detail without sacrificing speedProfessional looking CDs/DVDs&mdash; print right onto ink jet printable CDs/DVDs without labelsSend faxes fast, even in color&mdash; fax in as fast as 3 seconds per page; store up to 60 speed dials and receive up to 180 pages in memory; also faxes legal&ndashsize; documents; includes PC Fax4softwareVersatile paper handling&mdash; automatic, two&ndash;sided printing with two automatic paper trays, plus 30&ndash;page Automatic Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of originalsEasily charge portable devices&mdash; free up a power outlet; charge cell phones and MP3 players2One&ndash;of&ndash;a&ndash;kind projects&mdash; easily create coloring books, personalized notepaper, invitations and greeting cards using your own photosPerfect photos made easy&mdash; Auto Photo Correction and red&ndash;eye removal with and without a computerBring old, faded photos back to life&mdash; easily restore the color to faded photosResults ready to share&mdash; lab quality photos are smudge, scratch, water and fade resistantEpson PreferredSMprogram&mdash; two&ndash;year limited warranty and free lifetime customer phone support with registration6Individual ink cartridges&mdash; replace only the color you needPrint from an iPhone or iPod touch&mdash; enjoy wireless printing from various mobile devicesPreferred 3 to 1 by consumers&mdash; Artisan series of all&ndash;in&ndash;ones are #1 in photo quality3Weight and Dimensions (WxDxH)&mdash; Weight: 23.1 lb, Storage: 18.3&quot; x 25.8&quot; x 7.8&quot;, Printing: 18.3&quot; x 18.0&quot; x 7.8&quot;Artisan productsUnleash your creativity with an Artisan.

        "description": "Everything photo paper can possibly have for the artwork of professional and advanced amateur photographers Canon's new flagship glossy photo paper surpasses Photo Paper Pro [PR-101]. Similar to Photo Paper Plus Glossy II (PP-201), a six layer paper structure is used to promote color reproduction \"Alumina\" which proved quicker ink absorbency on Photo Paper Pro [PR -101] is adopted in the ink-receiving layers.Advancing the texture and quality of Canon's new glossy photo paper\"Make the best photo paper in all aspects.\" This was our commitment when we were developing Photo Paper Pro [PR-101], which was Canon's previous flagship photo paper.To further progress, we follow this commitment and have developed Canon's new flagship glossy photo paper. Ink-receiving layers are functionally separated into a color-reproduction layer and an absorbing layer, and a chromogenic enhancer which amplifies light is added into the resin-coat layer.A neutral white which has a high degree of whiteness is adopted for the color of the paper.The demanding photo quality needs of professional and advanced amateur photographer is realized when used with Canon's 2008 new dye-based inks [CLI-221]. The color reproduction in red areas is expanded, rich and deep blacks are achieved and the higher image durability is achieved. The best glossy photo paper which turns printouts to artwork. That is Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT-101].For professional and advanced amateur photographers Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT- 101] exceeds Photo Paper Pro [PR-101] by using original material technologyNeutral bright white for maximum appeal to professional advanced amateur photographersA new standard for white has been introducedThere are various \"whites\" for a white paper such as bluish white, yellowish white, dark white and bright white.The \"white\" Canon chose for professional's and advanced amateur's artwork from these various \"whites\" is the \"white\" which combines \"crispy white\" and \"neutral white\".\"Crispy white\" contributes to enhance the gamut volume. This provides more vivid color reproduction. And this vividness won't be unnatural thanks to the \"neutral white\". It will produce a natural color which dye itself produces.There are scenes where the whiteness of Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT-101] will be utilized such as the gradation of a morning glow in which colors blend intricately, the transparency of a glass and the texture of metals. But it is on the human skin which is the most common but the most difficult to express that it will show the most obvious whiteness.Ink absorption is speedy and dyes are fixed to a top layer in the paper. That is why images can be expressed beautifully and smoothlyBecause of the Alumina, quick ink absorbency is achievedThe shape of alumina pigment which is the pro_main material in the ink-receiving layers of Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT- 101] is \"plate-like\". On the other hand, silica pigment which is often used for affordable photo paper is a \"spherical shape\". Both alumina and silica use binders which play a gluing role to join pigments but a \"plate-like\" alumina uses less binders, so it can absorb inks quicker than the silica ink-receiving layers.Because the layer is separated into two layers, quick solid-liquid separation is achievedThe ink-receiving layers of Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT- 101] are separated into two layers and the amount of binder in each layer is optimized. It gives specific functions for each layer, the top layer is for color reproduction and the bottom layer is for absorption. This is how solid-liquid separation of color material elements and solvent elements can be processed quickly.More vivid color and higher resolution compared to Photo Paper Pro [PR-101], which has a single ink-receiving layer, is achieved. Since Alumina is adopted and the ink-receiving layers are separated into two layers, Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT-101] is able to produce prints with richer gradation, smoother expression, more vivid color and higher resolution.The dye is fixed to the surface of the paper, resulting in deeper blacks and a clearer overall photographic finishDeeper blacks in combination with new black dye inkThere are various blacks for the \"black\" in photographs such as bluish black, yellowish black, reddish black and greenish black.A deep, rich black is a \"black\" that looks truly black to the eye. Rich, deep blacks are not only important for reproducing deep-black areas of photos, they also contribute to the overall density, contrast and vividness of the photo. If the black is light, it weakens the photo's impact, and makes the photo plain.Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT-101] is developed to produce a deep, rich black by fixing the dye close to the surface of the paper. Canon has also been trying to make the black ink neutral, and achieved the creation of the deeper \"black\" in combination with Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT-101] and 2008 new dye-based black ink [CLI-221].Photos are beautifully reproduced because the dye is fixed close to the surface of the paperThe ink-receiving layer on the surface of the paper accepts the dyes in the ink and produces the color. If this layer is too thick, the dyes will spread into the bottom making it difficult to gain enough density. However by making the ink-receiving layer simply thinner, it causes the water in the ink to overflow to the paper's surface.Quick solid-liquid separation fixes the dye to the surface of the paperPhoto Paper Pro Platinum [PT-101] solves this dilemma using innovative inkjet coating technology. Using this technology, the ink-receiving layer is split into two layers, a color-reproduction layer on which the dye is fixed and an absorbing layer that soaks up the excess water solvent.This layered structure enables the dye to be fixed closer to the surface of the paper, improving the density of the black ink compared with Photo Paper Pro [PR-101]. This novel technology achieves rich, deep blacks and bright, vivid photographic results. At the same time, the absorbing layer quickly mops up excess water solvent, for crisp, sharp image quality.Enhancement for color reproduction in red areas and the ability to express expands furtherWider color gamut makes artworks of professionals and advanced amateurs more attractiveThe wider the color gamut is, the more colors that can be reproduced. The combination of Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT-101] and 2008 new dye-based inks [CLI-221] greatly expands color reproduction especially in red areas (yellow ~ red ~ magenta) compared to the combination of Photo Paper Pro [PR-101] and the previous dye ink [CLI-8]. It brings out PIXMA's full ability to produce photos and achieves the reproduction of richer and more vivid colors.Color reproduction is stabilized faster than ever before, so you can appreciate the beauty of your photos right awayOptical density immediately after printing is greater than ever, so you see the real colors of your photos, right awayWith ordinary inkjet paper, the colors emerge gradually so you cannot quickly see the final results of the photo including color and contrast. Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT-101] is a completely different experience. The optical density (color density) is high immediately after printing, and color reproduction happens fast. In less time than ever, a reproduction of the colors of the original photo is complete. Images are bright and vivid as soon as the print job is finished.Improved durability (light fastness/gas fastness) by adding the new durability enhancer in ink-receiving layersCanon focused on both paper and ink, and worked on things paper can do and things ink can do to improve image durability of photo prints. Based on the discoloration mechanisms (presumption) of the color material, the discoloration of color material have been successfully minimized by adding the new durability enhancer in the ink-receiving layers.Mechanisms for photo image deterioration (Presumption)The Mechanisms for photo image deterioration (Presumption) caused by gas and light. Canon presumed the mechanisms of discoloration of printouts is pro_mainly caused by these three deteriorative reactions listed below.The reaction of incoming gas deteriorates the color materialThe deteriorative chain reaction starts because of the material generated in the process aboveThe chain reaction of light through oxygen deteriorates the color materialThe approach to Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT-101]Canon discovered the \"new additives\" to minimize the discoloration of the color material from the discoloration mechanisms of printouts and successfully introduced it to Photo Paper Pro Platinum [PT-101].",

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the &quot;MPG&quot; ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsGet more done&mdash; up to 2x faster than leading competitive ink jets, when printing laser quality text1Wide&ndash;format prints&mdash; view every detail with large prints up to 13&quot; x 19&quot;Speed through critical documents&mdash; maximum print speeds of 30 ppm black/17 ppm color; laser quality speeds of 13 ppm black, 5.5 ppm color (letter size)Protect important documents&mdash; instant&ndash;dry ink for smudge, fade and water resistant prints; highlighter&ndash;friendly tooOne printer for everyday projects, large&ndash;size prints and more&mdash; print index cards, documents, stationery and spreadsheetsDependable&mdash; engineered for reliable paper feedingIndividual ink cartridges&mdash; replace only the color you needPrint more, change cartridges less often&mdash; Dual Black ink cartridges included,3High&ndash;capacity Black, Cyan, Magenta and Yellow ink cartridges availableSave energy&mdash; uses up to 70% less power than a laser printer4Save paper&mdash; save up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two&ndash;sided printing2Product protection you can count on&mdash; 1&ndash;year limited warranty; access to exclusive templates, tutorials and offers with product registrationWeight and Dimensions (WxDxH)&mdash; Weight: 26.3 lb, Storage: 24.3&quot; x 12.7&quot; x 8.5&quot;, Printing: 24.3&quot; x 31.4&quot; x 16.4&quot;Recommended SuppliesEpson Ink Supplies68 DURABrite Ultra High&ndash;capacity Black dual&ndash;pack (T068120-D2)68 DURABrite Ultra Color mulit&ndash;pack (T068520)69 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge (T069120)69 DURABrite Ultra Cyan ink cartridge (T069220)69 DURABrite Ultra Magenta ink cartridge (T069320)69 DURABrite Ultra Yellow ink cartridge (T069420)69 DURABrite Ultra color multi&ndash;pack (T069520)*69 standard&ndash;capacity &mdash; 68 high&ndash;capacityWhat&rsquo;s in the BoxWorkForce 1100 color ink jet printer, instruction manual, CD&ndash;ROM with drivers and bonus software, power cord, 5 DURABrite Ultra ink cartridges: two 68 High&ndash;capacity Black ink cartridges, three 68 High&ndash;capacity color ink cartridges: 1 Cyan, 1 Magenta, 1 YellowWorkForce products &mdash; Engineered for businessShow the world what your business is made of with WorkForce, Epson&rsquo;s exclusive line of printers and all&ndash;in&ndash;ones that are engineered for better business productivity.

It also meets HP's ColorLok Technology performance standard, a more advanced printing standard than ordinary plain papers that helps colors leap off the page as well as prevent smears.FeaturesCreated especially for both InkJet and LaserJet all-in-one machinesFor every type of document producedFormulated to help all-in-one machines produce crisper, sharper text and richer, deeper colorsHeavier, thicker and brighter than ordinary multi-use papersColorLok Technology for brighter colors, fewer smears, and bolder blacksAcid-free for longer-lasting documentsSpecificationsMedia dimensions: 8.5 x 11 inchesSheets per package: 500Brightness: 96U.S. page weight: 22 lb==HP Printer Paper Section==========Select The Best Paper For Any JobWhether for professional, creative, or everyday use, HP helps take the guesswork out of finding the perfect inkjet or LaserJet paper for any project.Why HP Paper Is ImportantNot all papers are created equal. Designed with each element of the HP printing process in mind, HP papers, toners, and inks are specially engineered to work together to deliver quality, reliable printing, as well as fade resistance, bolder blacks and more vibrant colors.Because HP papers are specifically formulated to work with HP printers, it's important to select the right HP paper for every job to ensure a crisp, clean finished product.Key HP Paper FeaturesCheck the label on HP paper packaging to find this key information:FinishConsider the look you want to achieve, and choose a finish that fits your needs:Glossy:For color images that really pop, try printing on a paper with a glossy finish.Matte:If printing a document with text, such as a term paper or resume, a matte finish can make your text easier to read.Satin:A satin finish will give your photos a smooth, professional touch.BrightnessThe brightness of your paper refers to the amount of light reflected from the surface of the paper, and is typically measured on a scale from 1 to 100. Print on brighter paper, such as HP Bright White Inkjet Paper, for higher contrast, crisper text, and a clean background for more vivid images.WeightThickness (measured in millimeters) and weight (measured in pounds), refer to the sturdiness and crease-resistance of your paper. HP paper comes in a variety of different weights.You may try using a heavier paper for artwork or pieces that will be frequently handled, like cards or brochures. Heavier paper can also help formal, more substantial printed pieces, such as resumes and invitations, stand out from the crowd.SizeHP offers many kinds of paper in a variety of sizes, from standard 8.5\" x 11\" paper, to 4\" x 6\" and 5\" x 7\" photo paper, to specialty sizes such as wide format and legal paper.Not all printers can handle all kinds of paper, so before stocking up, check your printer manual for paper size and weight capabilities.Choose Paper Suited To Specific TasksWhether printing driving directions, invoices, snapshots for the fridge, or formal wedding invitations, HP has the paper you need to get the job done.Multipurpose PrintingFor basic home and office printing, a simple, multipurpose paper is your best bet. Many HP multipurpose papers now feature ColorLok technology for more vibrant colors, bolder blacks, and fewer smears. Engineered with special additives that chemically react with inkjet inks, ColorLok paper absorbs ink deeper into the paper while holding the pigment closer to the surface, delivering impeccable print quality every time.HP Multipurpose Paper for Injet PrintersBright finish and smooth surface for sharp, professional-looking results.ColorLok technologyUsage Ideas: General office documents including copies and faxesHP Bright White Inkjet PaperBright, blue-white finish for sharper contrast and more vibrant colorColorLok technologyUsage Ideas: Proposals, presentations and newslettersHP LaserJet PaperBright finishThicker than standard paperHigh opacity prevents show-throughUsage Ideas: General office documents, especially documents that combine text with spot colors.Photo PrintingWhen you print on HP photo paper, you get professional, lab-quality photo prints every time.

The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsBuilt&ndash;in Wi&ndash;Fi, plus Ethernet, networking&mdash; print, scan,   and access memory card slots1from any room in the house with   built&ndash;in wireless and wired networkingUltra Hi&ndash;Definition prints&mdash; brilliant 4&quot; x 6&quot; photos   in as fast as 10 seconds; DX5MicroPiezo technology provides the finest   color and detail without sacrificing speedProfessional looking CDs/DVDs&mdash; print right onto ink jet printable   CDs/DVDs without labelsVersatile paper handling&mdash; automatic, two&ndash;sided printing and two   automatic paper trays for photo and standard paperEasily charge portable devices&mdash; free up a power outlet; charge cell   phones and MP3 players2One&ndash;of&ndash;a&ndash;kind projects&mdash; easily create coloring   books, personalized notepaper, invitations and greeting cards using your own photosPerfect photos made easy&mdash; Auto Photo Correction and red&ndash;eye   removalBring old, faded photos back to life&mdash; easily restore the color to   faded photosResults ready to share&mdash; lab quality photos are smudge, scratch, water   and fade resistantEpson PreferredSMprogram&mdash; two&ndash;year   limited warranty and free lifetime customer phone support with   registration3Individual ink cartridges&mdash; replace only the color you needSleek compact design&mdash; about as tall as a soda can; fits in any   settingPreferred 3 to 1 by consumers&mdash; Artisan series of   all&ndash;in&ndash;ones are #1 in photo quality4Weight and Dimensions (WxDxH)&mdash; Weight: 21.4 lb, Storage: 17.6&quot; x   18.0&quot; x 5.9&quot;, Printing: 17.6&quot; x 25.8&quot; x 5.9&quot;Artisan productsUnleash your creativity with an Artisan.

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the &quot;MPG&quot; ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsShare one all-in-one at home&mdash; print wirelessly from multiple PCs, now with Wi-Fi CERTIFIED n2World&rsquo;s fastest all-in-one1&mdash; print web pages and documents at speeds of 15 ISO ppm (black), 7.2 ISO ppm (color),&dagger;based on the ISO standardSave paper&mdash; automatic two-sided printing can save up to 50% of your paper supply at speeds of 7.6 ISO ppm (black), 4.6 ISO ppm (color),&dagger;based on the ISO standardReload paper less often&mdash; large paper tray holds up to 150 sheets of plain paperSupports wireless printing from your cell phone&mdash; easily print photos and more from your iPhone and many mobile devices3PC-free photo printing&mdash; it&rsquo;s easy with the built-in 2.5&quot; LCD and built in memory card slotsVibrant photos in no time&mdash; print a 4&quot; x 6&quot; photo in as fast as 20 sec&dagger;Superior image enhancement tools&mdash; automatically correct poorly exposed photos and easily remove red eyeHigh quality scanning&mdash; up to 2400 dpiTruly touchable photos and documents&mdash; get worry-free handling with instant-dry inksSave money&mdash; Extra High-capacity Black and color ink cartridges available4Standard ink set included&mdash; includes one 125 Black ink cartridge and three 125 color ink cartridgesExtra high-capacity ink cartridges available&mdash; save about 35%.4Packaging Specifications (W x D x H)&mdash; Dimensions: Printing 17.5&quot; x 22.2&quot; x 6.7&quot;, Storage 17.5&quot; x 14.4&quot; x 6.7&quot; and Weight 13.7 lb.Epson Stylus NX seriesSmart.

        "description": "Most new office chairs are equipped with hard caster wheels designed to be used on carpeted floors. But what if the chair ends up on a hard surface such as hardwood, linoleum, tile, concrete, etc? If this happens, the hard caster wheels will scratch or permanently damage your expensive hardwood, linoleum or tile floors. The solution is to replace the hard caster wheels with these polyurethane caster wheels. The softer polyurethane material will prevent the wheels from scratching the hard floor while allowing the wheels to roll smoothly. Besides cosmetic, safety is another reason why polyurethane caster wheel should be used on hard flooring. Polyurethane provides better traction on hard floor thus reduce the chance of accidental slipping. Easy installation, just pull out the old caster wheels and snap these polyurethane caster wheels into place. No tools necessary. For optimum performance, all five caster wheels should be installed. Mixing different types of wheels may cause uneven rolling. Rolland (TM) polyurethane caster wheels is tested to the industry ANSI/BIFMA safety standard. High quality assurance with 30 days money back satisfaction guarantee.",

All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.By using this remanufactured product, you are reducing the amount of waste being deposited into landfills. Instead of using a newly manufactured toner, by purchasing this remanufactured version you are participating in the highest form of recycling: re-use. While not every component within the toner can be reused, we do re-use those components that meet our quality standards and replace the rest with new quality components.Environmental stewardship is an important practice, and our goal is to re-use as many of the components as possible without degrading product performance. When the cartridges are no longer remanufacturable, or components no longer adhere to our quality specifications, the components will be disposed off. For example, the metals will be stripped from the cartridge body and sent to a local recycler, the plastics are sent for conversion to waste energy, and corrugate box materials are locally recycled. We also use electro-coagulation to treat manufacturing waste water, use degradable black bags to protect sensitive cartridge components during shipping, and our facility recycles cans, bottles and paper products.STMC--Certified for Quality and ValueOur manufacturer's dedication to developing and following documented practices has earned them STMC (Standardized Test Methods Committee) certification for their testing practices.Every toner cartridge begins with a thorough inspection process to ensure only those cartridges that can be returned to full functionality are used. We use technicians that are trained not just on the equipment they operate, but on the processes and procedures required to produce a quality, value cartridge.First, the technicians disassemble the cartridges to inspect each critical wear component to determine if it should be re-used or replaced. The cartridge is then moved to the filling operation where precision machinery deposits toner formulated for the specific cartridge type. Before shipping, the cartridge is tested to confirm that it works correctly.When you receive your new AmazonBasics remanufactured replacement toner cartridge, if you'd like to recycle your used toner cartridge, from any manufacturer, simply go to the helpful hints on this page for recycling instructions.AmazonBasics: Quality Products at Low PricesAmazonBasics is a collection of consumer electronic \"basics\" created by combining quality and low prices for an overall focus on value.Amazon Frustration-Free PackagingThis AmazonBasics product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging that is recyclable.

        "description": "Ideal for travelers, trade show exhibitors, and anyone else who frequently schleps boxes and other gear from place to place, the Magna Cart personal hand truck is engineered with toughness in mind. The 7-pound hand truck is made of sturdy rustproof aluminum, with a telescoping handle that extends to 39 inches tall. As a result, both tall and short users can comfortably haul up to 150 pounds at once. The 5-inch rubber wheels, meanwhile, roll smoothly on virtually any surface, from pavement to trim carpet to linoleum. Best of all, the truck folds up compactly for storage or carrying, with a footprint of only 25 inches tall and 2 inches wide. The hand truck's narrow profile makes it ideal for carrying on planes (it fits easily in overhead compartments), trains, and cars, and when you're not using it, simply hang it on a peg in the garage or stow it next to the fridge.Certified Frustration-Free PackagingAmazon.com has certified this product's packaging is Frustration-Free.

        "description": "For haters eager to see Kanye hit a sophomore slump--no such luck.Late Registrationcan't replicate the novelty of last year'sCollege Dropout, but otherwise, this is an impressively more mature and labored-over album. Lyrically, Kanye's only improved a notch but musically, the album sounds incredible, especially with co-producer Jon Brion helping polish the songs to perfection. Tracks like \"Heard 'Em Say\" (featuring Maroon 5's Adam Levine) and \"Hey Mama,\" are richly textured in their soulfulness while the flint-edge of \"Crack Music\" and \"Gone\" (feat. Cam'ron) will appeal to the street-oriented. There's a few duds on here--the sickly-sweet, syrupy \"Bring Me Down\" (feat. Brandy) being one of the worst offenders--but when the album's good, it's very, very good. In short, Kanye's detractors may not be swayed in their resistance to his charms but not only will his past supporters be rewarded butLate Registrationhas enough appeal to earn new crowds of fans.--Oliver Wang",

This replacement ink cartridge is made in the USA from new and recycled components. It is neither sponsored nor endorsed by Brother. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.By utilizing the remanufactured version of this ink, you are reducing the amount of waste being deposited into landfills. Instead of using a newly manufactured ink cartridge, by simply purchasing this remanufactured version, you are participating in the highest form of recycling: reuse. While not every component within the ink cartridge can be reused, we do ensure the best used and new components are obtained to deliver value and quality.Environmental stewardship is an important practice, and our goal is to re-use as many of the components as possible without degrading product performance. When the cartridges are no longer remanufacturable, or components no longer adhere to our quality specifications, the components will be disposed. For example, the metals will be stripped from the cartridge body and sent to a local recycler, the plastics are sent for conversion to waste energy, and corrugate box materials are locally recycled. We also use electro-coagulation to treat manufacturing waste water, use degradable black bags to protect sensitive cartridge components during shipping, and our facility recycles cans, bottles and paper products.STMC--Certified for Quality and ValueOur manufacturer's dedication to developing and following documented practices has earned them STMC (Standardized Test Methods Committee) certification for their testing practices.The quality control of the remanufacturing process begins before any cartridge is brought onto the production line. Experienced engineers develop specific quality processes for each cartridge type. The operators who are reviewing the cartridges are trained on not just the equipment they operate, but on the processes and procedures required to produce a quality, value cartridge.First, each cartridge is cleaned and inspected to determine whether it meets the quality requirements for remanufacturing. Once a cartridge has been approved for remanufacturing, the process begins with a thorough cleaning procedure to remove waste ink, and, if needed, replace various components. As the cartridge passes through each stage of the remanufacturing process, it is tested to confirm that the cartridge functions correctly.A postage-paid recycle-return bag is included with your new remanufactured cartridge so you can return your empty cartridge for recycling.AmazonBasics: Quality Products at Low PricesAmazonBasics is a collection of consumer electronic \"basics\" created by combining quality and low prices for an overall focus on value.Amazon Frustration-Free PackagingThis AmazonBasics product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging that is recyclable. It comes without excess packaging materials such as hard plastic clamshell casings, plastic bindings, or wire ties. The packaging is designed to be opened without the use of a box cutter or knife, and it will protect your product just as well as traditional packaging. Products with Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging can frequently be shipped in their own boxes, without an additional shipping box, saving on resources and reducing waste. In addition, the packaging materials that we use are easily and frequently recycled, composted, or reused by our customers, and all the inks and dyes are biodegradable.WarrantyThis ink cartridge is backed by an AmazonBasics 1-year limited warranty.

        "description": "We're definitely taking this along with us the next time we shop for a house. Though it takes a little effort to master the collection of financial worksheets available on the Texas Instruments BA II Plus, you'll be glad you invested the time and money in this fine financial calculator.The BA II Plus operates in standard calculator and worksheet modes. The standard mode lets you perform common math as well as operations involving the time value of money--that is, applications such as mortgages or annuities in which payments are equal and evenly spaced. You can also perform trigonometric functions in standard mode.The more hard-core worksheet mode includes tables for amortization, bond, depreciation, and compound interest. If you're not familiar with such calculations, the very helpful user's manual will guide you through the process. All previous worksheet values are stored in memory, so you don't have to retype all the bond maturity or cash flow analysis figures.The average user who wants to calculate a basic loan payment will be more comfortable working in the standard calculator mode. We were using the BA II Plus tools for calculating basic interest and payment periods within minutes. Still, it's good to know that the more advanced features are available for those who require heavy-duty financial computing.Finance students and average users alike will find much to like in the Texas Instruments BA II Plus.--John Frederick Moore",

This replacement toner cartridge is made in the USA from new and recycled components. It is neither sponsored nor endorsed by Brother. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.By using this remanufactured product, you are reducing the amount of waste being deposited into landfills. Instead of using a newly manufactured toner, by purchasing this remanufactured version you are participating in the highest form of recycling: re-use. While not every component within the toner can be reused, we do re-use those components that meet our quality standards and replace the rest with new quality components.Environmental stewardship is an important practice, and our goal is to re-use as many of the components as possible without degrading product performance. When the cartridges are no longer remanufacturable, or components no longer adhere to our quality specifications, the components will be disposed off. For example, the metals will be stripped from the cartridge body and sent to a local recycler, the plastics are sent for conversion to waste energy, and corrugate box materials are locally recycled. We also use electro-coagulation to treat manufacturing waste water, use degradable black bags to protect sensitive cartridge components during shipping, and our facility recycles cans, bottles and paper products.STMC--Certified for Quality and ValueOur manufacturer's dedication to developing and following documented practices has earned them STMC (Standardized Test Methods Committee) certification for their testing practices.Every toner cartridge begins with a thorough inspection process to ensure only those cartridges that can be returned to full functionality are used. We use technicians that are trained not just on the equipment they operate, but on the processes and procedures required to produce a quality, value cartridge.First, the technicians disassemble the cartridges to inspect each critical wear component to determine if it should be re-used or replaced. The cartridge is then moved to the filling operation where precision machinery deposits toner formulated for the specific cartridge type. Before shipping, the cartridge is tested to confirm that it works correctly.When you receive your new AmazonBasics remanufactured replacement toner cartridge, if you'd like to recycle your used toner cartridge, from any manufacturer, simply go to the helpful hints on this page for recycling instructions.AmazonBasics: Quality Products at Low PricesAmazonBasics is a collection of consumer electronic \"basics\" created by combining quality and low prices for an overall focus on value.Amazon Frustration-Free PackagingThis AmazonBasics product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging that is recyclable.

It's fast, too; printing a beautiful photo lab quality 4\" x  6\" borderless photo takes approximately 55 seconds.For improved copying performance, AE (Auto Exposure) Copy feature automatically optimizes reproduction quality based on the type of original you're duplicating. Whether you're copying your photos, text documents or a mix of both, the MP450 Photo All-In-One automatically adjusts the exposure to give you the best output possible. When scanning photos or graphics, you'll see high-quality 1,200-dpi reproductions with vibrant 48-bit color depth. Plus, the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed interface enables the fastest possible image transfers and scanning speeds.Using the built-in 1.9\" color LCD viewer, you can actually see your images in full color and enhance them before printing. Just insert your compatible memory card into one of the built-in card slots. As needed, the PIXMA MP450 Photo All-In-One Printer will automatically correct for red eye, improve sharpness and enhance the light values on your subjects' faces. You can also fine tune the images yourself using the easy control panel. As another convenient option, you can print directly from your PictBridge-ready devices such as digital cameras, with automatic face brightening.The Canon ChromaLife100 system combines the PIXMA MP450 Photo All-In-One's FINE print head technology and newly developed inks with select Canon photo papers, with results rivaling that of many conventional photos. These beautiful photos will also last up to 100 years when stored in an archival quality photo album.What's in the Box:PIXMA MP450 Photo All-in-One, power cord, FINE cartridges: PG-50 black, CL- 51 color, documentation kit, Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy for Borderless Printing 4\" x 6\" sample pack",

Songs with influences from every decade of rock and roll will help students make meaning of tricky scientific topics such as circulation, photosynthesis, speed and velocity, and states of matter.Additionally, the music and video help to dispel common scientific myths, as well as inspires the use of scientific inquiry at every level. Using real-world connections students can relate to, a stimulating soundtrack that educates, and eye-popping graphics that punch the point make Here Comes Science a great teaching tool.Teachers can use the songs and video to begin a unit of study, assess prior knowledge of a topic to help plan instruction, differentiate instruction, stimulate further discussion of a topic, expose students to new concepts, and develop science vocabulary and comprehension. --Susan Lee Poage, Kindergarten Teacher Professor of Early Childhood Education Winner of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Teaching Science and Mathematics",

This phone system also features text-to-speech technology, which announces the Caller ID information between rings. The system also boasts a talking alarm clock that will tell you when it's time for lunch, a 50-entry digital phone book, a digital answering machine, multilingual support (English and Spanish) and a talking battery alert that politely tells you when your battery is low with a \"please charge phone\" reminder. Each handset comes with a battery that supports five hours of talk time and 11 days of standby time, and the system can be expanded to up to six handsets.What's in the BoxFour Panasonic DECT 6.0 phones, base, three cradles, and power supplies.",

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the &quot;MPG&quot; ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsEasy to use for everyday projects&mdash; quick setup and user-friendly features like one-touch copying and scanningFaster print speeds, without compromising quality&mdash; maximum print speeds of 30 ppm black, 15 ppm color and laser quality print speeds of 3 ppm black, 1.6 ppm colorUnsurpassed print quality&mdash; get sharp documents and photos with precision detail and more accurate colorQuickly scan and archive&mdash; use included software to scan important documents and photos and save them as JPEGs or PDFsHigh quality copies, fast&mdash; one-touch copying in color or black-and-whiteTruly touchable photos and documents&mdash; instant-dry inkReplace only the color you need&mdash; individual ink cartridges, available in different sizesStandard ink set included&mdash; includes one 88 Black ink cartridge and three 88 color ink cartridgesWeight and Dimensions (W x D x H)&mdash; Printing: 17.1&quot; x 18.5&quot; x 11.9&quot;, Storage: 17.1&quot; x 12.9&quot; x 7.3&quot; and Weight 11.1 lb.Eco featuresSave up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two-sided printing2ENERGY STAR&reg;qualifiedDesigned to be Recycled3Epson Ink Supplies69 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge (T069120)69 DURABrite Ultra Cyan ink cartridge (T069220)69 DURABrite Ultra Magenta ink cartridge (T069320)69 DURABrite Ultra Yellow ink cartridge (T069420)69 DURABrite Ultra color multi-pack (3 colors) (T069520)Epson Paper SuppliesBright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586)Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in,20 sheets (S041331)Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)What&rsquo;s in the BoxStylus NX115 All-in-OneInstruction bookletCD-ROM containing all-in-one drivers and software for Windows and Macintosh&reg;One 88 Black ink cartridgeOne 88 Cyan ink cartridgeOne 88 Magenta ink cartridgeOne 88 Yellow ink cartridgeEpson Stylus NX seriesSmart.

At the touch of a button, the Jumbl image digitizer will scan and convert your old memories into sharp, vibrant digital images in JPEG format. These can then be viewed on your computer or other device, or printed out as regular photos.With our film and slide scanner, all you need to convert your images are included in the box.  There is no need for a computer connection to operate the Jumbl scanner. It scans, and converts images on its own, making it a very portable, accessible solution for digitizing films and slides. Scanning is also very easy and straightforward. Simply load the film or slide onto the negatives or positives holder, respectively. Follow the included instructions to slide the holder into place, and press the \"Scan\" button when ready. Snap! Your image has been converted and saved to the internal memory or an optional SD card.Once scanning is complete, the built-in 2.4-inch color LCD screen will display your digitized image. A clever piece of software allows you to flip the scanned image around by pressing a few buttons. This helps compensate for user error during scanning, and also adds some flexibility with image conversion. In addition, you can also adjust scanning resolution, brightness and coloration in the easy-to-navigate Capture menu.In the Box You'll find:1 x Digital Scanner1 x USB Cable1 x Negatives (Film) Holder1 x Positives (Slide) Holder1 x AC/DC Adapter1 x Cleaning Brush1 x TV Cable1 x User Manual",

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the &quot;MPG&quot; ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsSpeed through critical tasks&mdash; 4.3 ISO ppm (black) and 2.2 ISO ppm (color)&dagger;Get more done&mdash; 30-page Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of originalsPC-Fax&mdash; fax documents directly from your computer1High-speed faxing in black and color&mdash; as fast as 3 seconds per page; speed dial storage up to 60 numbers; fax memory up to 180 pagesSmudge, fade and water resistant prints&mdash; documents rival those from a laser printer; highlighter-friendly tooSave energy&mdash; uses up to 70% less power than laser printers2Save paper&mdash; save up to 50% of your paper supply with manual two-sided printing3Convert scanned documents into editable text&mdash; ABBYY FineReader includedIndividual ink cartridges&mdash; replace only the color you needProduct protection you can count on&mdah; one-year limited warranty; phone support, without charge, for the life of the product4Packaging Specifications (W x D x H)&mdash; Dimensions: Printing 18.1&quot; x 21.3&quot; x 11.9&quot;, Storage 18.1&quot; x 16.2&quot; x 9.3&quot; and Weight 15.7 lb.The WorkForce seriesEngineered for Business.Small businesses have big expectations.

Redington and William H. Sanford, Jr., the Sharpie Fine Point marker hit the market in 1964. It quickly became known as the first pen-style permanent marker that could write on almost any surface--from glass, wood and stone, to plastic, metal and, of course, paper. Endorsed by celebrities like NBC talk show hosts Johnny Carson and Jack Parr, the Sharpie marker quickly gained prominence.In the late nineties and early 2000s, the company introduced Sharpie markers in a variety of new, fun colors, including aqua, berry, turquoise and lime. By the end of 2002, over 200 million Sharpie markers had been produced, enough for approximately two Sharpie markers for every household in America!",

Two Panasonic 5.8 GHz PhonesNow, we've made it easier to enjoy all the benefits of our functional, fashionable and flexible phone systems by putting two in one package. With this two-in-one bundle system you get one base unit, 1 charger and two handsets. And just like Panasonic's expandable systems you only need one phone jack to operate both handsets! Plus, this dual-handset system uses Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum technology to ensure great sound, incredible clarity, long range and excellent security from eavesdropping.Check out the Panasonic KX-TG5632M 5.8 GHz base features.View example.Check out the Panasonic KX-TG5632M 5.8 GHz handset features.View larger.Long Range, Clear Sound, Minimal InterferenceOur 5.8 GHz Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum technology operates on a different wavelength with much less traffic than the 2.4 GHz technology while maintaining the great security, incredible clarity and long range. Have a wireless computer network, or thinking about getting one? 5.8 GHz technology will not interfere with wireless networks such as 802.11b or 802.11g Wi-Fi.All-Digital Answering SystemThis phone system is equipped with an all-digital answering system for quick, easy retrieval of crystal-clear messages. Message operation has never been easier, with up to 15 minutes of recording time, plus such features as pre-recorded outgoing message, remote operation, Tollsaver, and skip-and-repeat. And don't worry about losing your messages when the power goes out-they're stored in flash memory so they're unaffected by power failure or interruptions.Kids Sleeping? The Antenna Will Signal You SilentlyThis year, we've found a way to shorten the handset antenna while still maintaining the long range that Panasonic customers have become accustomed to. But what's even cooler is that the base of the antenna--which lights up--will alert you to an incoming call (or a message waiting for you1). Select from blue, green, amber or multi-color options. With Light-Up ID2, you can choose a light-up indicator color, blue, green, amber or multi-color, to link to your preprogrammed phone book data. The light-up indicator will flash quickly to show that you have an incoming call, and it will flash slowly to let you know you have a new message in your voice mailbox. So turn off the ringer, let the kids sleep, and never miss a call.Put the Phone Down While You TalkHaving a handset speakerphone may not seem like such a big deal-until you have to call an automated phone system. By the time you press \"2\" and return the phone to your ear, you missed half the next option! And when they put you on hold for ten minutes, do you really need to hold the phone? Not with the handset speakerphone. Just listen along, and press a button or pick up when it's convenient. You'll think up other great uses, like letting Grandma and Grandpa listen to their new grandchild at the same time, painting your nails as you talk to your best friend, or just being able to set the phone down while you talk.1. Requires subscription to voice mail service from your phone company.2.

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the &quot;MPG&quot; ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Eco featuresENERGY STAR&reg;qualifiedSave up to 50% on paper with manual, two-sided printing4Designed to be Recycled5Epson America, Inc. is a SmarWaySMTransport Partner6Epson Ink Supplies125 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge (T125120)125 DURABrite Ultra Cyan ink cartridge (T125220)125 DURABrite Ultra Magenta ink cartridge (T125320)125 DURABrite Ultra Yellow ink cartridge (T125420)125 DURABrite Ultra color multi-pack (3 colors) (T125520)Epson Paper SuppliesPremium Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in,50 sheets (S041257)Bright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586)Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in,20 sheets (S041331)Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)What&rsquo;s in the BoxStylus NX420 All-in-OneInstruction bookletsCD-ROM with driversPower cord4 DURABrite Ultra Ink cartridges (one 125 Standard-capacity Black ink cartridge and three 125 Standard-capacity color ink cartridges: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)&dagger;What is ISO ppm?ISO ppm is based on the new international standard for measuring print speed.

Switch the sensor to 300 DPI for 2-second color scans and a quick 1- second mono scan.The included MagicScan software features full-fledged optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities. With picture direct scanning, scanned images are inserted directly into your software of choice (e.g. Microsoft Office, MSN, Skype).

This replacement toner cartridge is made in the USA from new and recycled components. It is neither sponsored nor endorsed by Brother. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.By using this remanufactured product, you are reducing the amount of waste being deposited into landfills. Instead of using a newly manufactured toner, by purchasing this remanufactured version you are participating in the highest form of recycling: re-use. While not every component within the toner can be reused, we do re-use those components that meet our quality standards and replace the rest with new quality components.Environmental stewardship is an important practice, and our goal is to re-use as many of the components as possible without degrading product performance. When the cartridges are no longer remanufacturable, or components no longer adhere to our quality specifications, the components will be disposed off. For example, the metals will be stripped from the cartridge body and sent to a local recycler, the plastics are sent for conversion to waste energy, and corrugate box materials are locally recycled. We also use electro-coagulation to treat manufacturing waste water, use degradable black bags to protect sensitive cartridge components during shipping, and our facility recycles cans, bottles and paper products.STMC--Certified for Quality and ValueOur manufacturer's dedication to developing and following documented practices has earned them STMC (Standardized Test Methods Committee) certification for their testing practices.Every toner cartridge begins with a thorough inspection process to ensure only those cartridges that can be returned to full functionality are used. We use technicians that are trained not just on the equipment they operate, but on the processes and procedures required to produce a quality, value cartridge.First, the technicians disassemble the cartridges to inspect each critical wear component to determine if it should be re-used or replaced. The cartridge is then moved to the filling operation where precision machinery deposits toner formulated for the specific cartridge type. Before shipping, the cartridge is tested to confirm that it works correctly.When you receive your new AmazonBasics remanufactured replacement toner cartridge, if you'd like to recycle your used toner cartridge, from any manufacturer, simply go to the helpful hints on this page for recycling instructions.AmazonBasics: Quality Products at Low PricesAmazonBasics is a collection of consumer electronic \"basics\" created by combining quality and low prices for an overall focus on value.Amazon Frustration-Free PackagingThis AmazonBasics product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging that is recyclable.

This replacement toner cartridge is made in the USA from new and recycled components. It is neither sponsored nor endorsed by Brother. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.By using this remanufactured product, you are reducing the amount of waste being deposited into landfills. Instead of using a newly manufactured toner, by purchasing this remanufactured version you are participating in the highest form of recycling: re-use. While not every component within the toner can be reused, we do re-use those components that meet our quality standards and replace the rest with new quality components.Environmental stewardship is an important practice, and our goal is to re-use as many of the components as possible without degrading product performance. When the cartridges are no longer remanufacturable, or components no longer adhere to our quality specifications, the components will be disposed off. For example, the metals will be stripped from the cartridge body and sent to a local recycler, the plastics are sent for conversion to waste energy, and corrugate box materials are locally recycled. We also use electro-coagulation to treat manufacturing waste water, use degradable black bags to protect sensitive cartridge components during shipping, and our facility recycles cans, bottles and paper products.STMC--Certified for Quality and ValueOur manufacturer's dedication to developing and following documented practices has earned them STMC (Standardized Test Methods Committee) certification for their testing practices.Every toner cartridge begins with a thorough inspection process to ensure only those cartridges that can be returned to full functionality are used. We use technicians that are trained not just on the equipment they operate, but on the processes and procedures required to produce a quality, value cartridge.First, the technicians disassemble the cartridges to inspect each critical wear component to determine if it should be re-used or replaced. The cartridge is then moved to the filling operation where precision machinery deposits toner formulated for the specific cartridge type. Before shipping, the cartridge is tested to confirm that it works correctly.When you receive your new AmazonBasics remanufactured replacement toner cartridge, if you'd like to recycle your used toner cartridge, from any manufacturer, simply go to the helpful hints on this page for recycling instructions.AmazonBasics: Quality Products at Low PricesAmazonBasics is a collection of consumer electronic \"basics\" created by combining quality and low prices for an overall focus on value.Amazon Frustration-Free PackagingThis AmazonBasics product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging that is recyclable.

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the &quot;MPG&quot; ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsIncrease your productivity&mdash; save time with the world&rsquo;s fastest all-in-one1in its classSpeed through critical documents&mdash; ISO print speeds2of 15 ISO ppm black, 9.3 ISO ppm colorDependable&mdash; instant&ndash;dry ink for smudge, fade and water resistant prints; highlighter&ndash;friendly tooPC fax&mdash; save paper by faxing documents directly from your computer4Easily share&mdash; Wi&ndash;Fi for wireless connectivity, and Ethernet for wired networkingPrint three times as much&mdash; get about 3x more prints than with our standard 69 ink cartridges, when using the included 97 Extra High&ndash;capacity ink cartridgeSmall footprint&mdash; takes up less space on your deskSave energy&mdash; uses up to 70% less power than a laser printer3Save paper&mdash; save up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two&ndash;sided printing5Get more done&mdash; 30&ndash;page Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of originalsHigh&ndash;speed faxing in black and color&mdash; as fast as 3 sec per page; speed dial storage up to 60 numbers; fax memory up to 180 pagesPC&ndash;free, borderless photos in a snap&mdash; 2.5&quot; LCD and memory card slots for easy transfer of filesIndividual ink cartridges&mdash; replace only the color you needProduct protection you can count on&mdash; 2&ndash;year limited warranty; phone support, without charge, for the life of the product; plus, access to exclusive templates, tutorials and offers with product registration6Weight and Dimensions (W x D x H)&mdash; Weight: 18.3 lb, Printing: 18.1&quot; x 22.1&quot; x 12&quot;, Storage: 18.1&quot; x 13.6&quot; x 9.3&quot;Eco featuresUses up to 70% less power than a laser printer3Save up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two&ndash;sided printing5ENERGY STAR&reg;qualifiedDesigned to be Recycled7Recommended SuppliesEpson Ink Supplies69 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge (T069120)69 DURABrite Ultra Cyan ink cartridge (T069220)69 DURABrite Ultra Magenta ink cartridge (T069320)69 DURABrite Ultra Yellow ink cartridge (T069420)69 DURABrite Ultra color multi&ndash;pack (3 colors) (T069520)Epson Paper SuppliesHeavyweight 8.5 x 11 in, Matte Paper, 50 sheets (S041257)Photo Quality Inkjet Paper, 100 sheets (S041062)Premium Semi&ndash;Gloss Photo Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331)Premium Glossy Photo Paper 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)What&rsquo;s in the BoxWorkForce 610 all&ndash;in&ndash;oneInstruction manualCD-ROM with drivers and bonus softwarePower cordTelephone cord4 DURABrite Ultra Ink cartridges; one 97 Extra High&ndash;capacity Black ink cartridge and three 68 High&ndash;capacity color ink cartridges: Cyan, Magenta, YellowWorkForce productsEngineered for business.Show the world what your business is made of with WorkForce, Epson&rsquo;s exclusive line of printers and all&ndash;in&ndash;ones that are engineered for better business productivity.

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the &quot;MPG&quot; ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsWi-Fi and Ethernet built in&mdash; share one printer with multiple PCs, wired or wirelessly; print, scan and share memory card files between your PC and printer, wirelessly1Fastest print speeds in its class&mdash; up to 2x faster than competitively priced models2; maximum print speeds of 36 ppm black/color, laser quality print speeds of 15 ppm black and 9.3 ppm color&dagger;PC-free, borderless photos in a snap&mdash; 2.5-inch, tilt LCD screen and built-in memory card slotsScan directly to e-mail4&mdash; restore the color to old, faded photos; better than the competitionSuperior image enhancement tools&mdash; red-eye removal, automatic photo restoration, Automatic Photo Correction and moreSave time&mdash; make multiple copies (1 &mdash; 99) with one touch; instantly reduce and enlarge copies 25 &ndash; 400%Manual Two-sided printing1&mdash; a great way to save paperReplace only the color you need&mdash; individual ink cartridges, available in different sizesTruly touchable photos and documents&mdash; instant-dry ink for smudge, fade and water resistant printsUnsurpassed print quality&mdash; get sharp documents and photos with precision detail and more accurate colorStandard ink set included&mdash; includes one 69 Black ink cartridge and three 69 color ink cartridgesPackaging Specifications&mdash; Dimensions 20.3 x 9.1 x 15.7 in (W x D x H) and Weight 16.5 lb.Eco featuresSave up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two-sided printing1ENERGY STAR&reg;qualifiedDesigned to be Recycled5Recommended SuppliesEpson Ink Supplies69 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge (T069120)69 DURABrite Ultra Cyan ink cartridge (T069220)69 DURABrite Ultra Magenta ink cartridge (T069320)69 DURABrite Ultra Yellow ink cartridge (T069420)69 DURABrite Ultra color multi-pack (3 colors) (T069520)*69 for standard-capacityEpson Paper SuppliesPremium Presentation Paper Matte Double-sided 8.5 x 11 in, 50 sheets (S041568)Bright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586)Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331)Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)What&rsquo;s in the BoxStylus NX515 All-in-OneInstruction bookletCD-ROM containing printer drivers and software (Windows and Macintosh&reg;)One 69 Black ink cartridgeOne 69 Cyan ink cartridgeOne 69 Magenta ink cartridgeOne 69 Yellow ink cartridgeEpson Stylus NX seriesSmart.

        "description": "From the Manufacturer The feature-rich Canon PIXMA MP780 Photo All-In-One delivers the ultimate combination of speed and quality to your home-office projects. It can print or copy up to 25 ppm in black and up to 17 ppm in color, and a 4-by-6-inch borderless photo takes about 36 seconds (1). You'll achieve up to Super G3 fax speed in color and black-and-white (2), and the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed interface enables the fastest image transfers and scanning speeds possible today (3).To further increase productivity, the integrated 35-page auto document feeder helps you speed through larger copy and fax jobs. A dual paper path allows you to keep a second type of paper ready for printing, an built-in two-sided printing (duplexing) saves time and paper. Plus, electronic sorting automatically collates your copies, so you don't have to.Precision Color Distribution TechnologyUnlike other systems, nozzle configuration in Bubble Jet printers is simple, so it is easier to make them smaller and more dense. Using its superior semiconductor manufacturing technology, Canon has succeeded in developing an ultrahigh-precision, multinozzle print head. The problem of color inconsistency has been solved by positioning a mirror-image line of 128 nozzles (600 dpi pitch for each color) at a half-pitch offset from the existing line. This configuration also provides the added advantage of enabling high-resolution printing at 1,200 dpi.The unit's ContrastPLUS 5-color ink system--four dye-based inks plus a pigment-based black ink--produces exceptional photos, along with laser-quality text. Canon Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) uses a high-performance 1,856-nozzle print head that ejects precise and consistent droplets as small as 2 picoliters. The results? Outstanding resolution of up to 4,800 x 1,200 color dpi and clear, detailed images (4). When scanning photos, you'll produce brilliant 2,400 dpi scans with intense 48-bit color depth.Easy-PhotoPrint v3.0While most photo-editing software applications will brighten the entire image, Easy-PhotoPrint 3.0 accurately detects the subject's face and adjusts the skin to the optimum tone. Brighten dark faces caused by bright backgrounds. Choose from one-click automatic to correct the entire image all at once, or manual to correct just a selected area.BeforeAfterEasy-PhotoPrint 3.0 also lets you select and print any image on your PC, perfectly trim images, correct images using lab-quality retouching features, correct red-eye, smooth facial lines and skin tone, sharpen faces, remove blemishes, and print in a variety of sizes and layouts.This printer can connect directly to select digital cameras.Learn more about PictBridge.The Canon Think Tank System has five individual ink tanks, so you replace only the color that runs out, not an entire cartridge containing unused ink. Plus, a low-ink sensor alerts you when a tank's ink level gets low. The bottom line is higher efficiency and lower printing costs (5).With direct photo printing, just connect to any PictBridge compatible digital camera or DV camcorder, and print! It's easy and there's no computer required (6).What's in the BoxPIXMA MP780 Photo All-in-One, PIXMA MP780 print head, BCI-3eBk black, BCI-6Bk black, BCI-6C cyan, BCI-6M magenta, BCI-6Y yellow, power cord, documentation kit, setup CD-ROMNotes:(1) PPM print speeds are based on the highest speed printer driver mode.

        "description": "Tired of dealing with the hassles of leaky water bottles and smelly glue sticks? Have a mailing project that needs to be finished yesterday? Treat yourself to this time-saving bottle of Dab n' Seal Envelope Moistener with Adhesive. A vital tool to be the model of efficiency in your world, the cap spins off and it&rsquo;s ready-to-use for rapid sealing with proficient ease--never lick an envelope again! If you love innovative new products that make your life and workplace easier and more efficient, this might just become your new best friend.Unique designThe revolutionary design and proprietary adhesive of the Dab n' Seal Envelope Moistener with Adhesive bottle produces a quick drying seal on any envelope or similar paper product.The applicator pad consistently lays down the desired amount of glue every time and the lightweight, comfortably molded design makes it easy to maneuver, giving you more precision.Unlike traditional straight-tube moisteners, this bottle is contoured in the center to fit more comfortably in your hand, avoiding awkward angles. The uniquely shaped tube is spill proof too--made from flexible plastic that doesn&rsquo;t bounce back when squeezed so you can predict how much will come out. No surprises here.&nbsp;The molded grip and patented non-clogging spring valve tip makes it easy to maneuver, reduces effort, and improves precision, making any repetitive task go much faster. The dome-shaped cap, molded to the shape of the applicator pad, spins on and off easily.Advanced adhesiveWhen you draw it across paper, the Dab n' Seal Envelope Moistener with Adhesive bottle smoothly lays down a straight, even&nbsp; and clear seal that is quick sealing and quick-drying. It forms a bond only where you want it--activating a gummed envelope seal or similar. Excess left on the outside of an envelope or scratch paper simply shrivels up and can be brushed off--never producing the black smudges common with glue sticks.The non-toxic, non-flammable, water-soluble light tack adhesive won&rsquo;t disturb ink and peels right off hard surfaces like desks and tabletops, so any errant clean up is a snap. The level indicator on the side lets you know when it&rsquo;s getting low and the cap will never get stuck on the bottle itself, because the glue doesn&rsquo;t adhere to plastic. This bottle is a must-have for the neat and organized, since it&rsquo;s cleaner than old sponges that can break apart or become moldy, and the gel isn&rsquo;t as runny as water and won&rsquo;t leave uneven clumps like glue sticks.If ever needing to re-activate, simply hold the tip in warm running water for a minute, and you&rsquo;re back in business.&nbsp;UsesUse this time-saving product whenever you need to make sure an envelope stays sealed throughout its journey. While water moisteners can wipe away an envelope&rsquo;s gum this adhesive enhances the bonding properties for a reliable and secure seal. Speed through holiday cards, wedding, party and graduation invitations, and any mass mailings, even kids' school projects. The Dab n' Seal Moistener with Adhesive bottle is a clean, efficient product and an easy way to boost productivity as it quickly and securely seals more than 1,500 envelopes.About Quality Park ProductsFor more than 90 years, Quality Park Products has been the envelope manufacturing and converting leader, and the industry's best source for imprinted products and services.

It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsSmart, 7.8&quot; touch panel&mdash; large display lights up only the buttons you need; includes a 3.5\" LCD to preview, edit and print photosUltra Hi-Definition prints from the world's fastest 4&quot; x 6&quot; photo printer2&mdash; brilliant 4&quot; x 6&quot; photos in as fast as 10 seconds&dagger;; DX5 MicroPiezo technology provides the finest color and detail without sacrificing speedBuilt-in wireless and Ethernet networking&mdash; built-in wireless (Wi-Fi CERTIFIED n)4and wired networking; print, scan, and access memory card slots3from any room in the houseSend faxes fast, even in color&mdash; fax in as fast as 3 seconds per page; store up to 60 speed dials and receive up to 180 pages in memory; also faxes legal-size documents; includes PC-Fax7softwareOne-of-a-kind projects&mdash; easily create coloring books, personal note paper, invitations and greeting cards using your own photosResults ready to share&mdash; lab quality photos are smudge, scratch, water and fade resistantPerfect photos made easy&mdash; Auto Photo Correction and red-eye removalVersatile paper handling&mdash; automatic two-sided printing with two paper trays, plus 30-page Automatic Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of originalsBring old, faded photos back to life&mdash; easily restore the color to faded photosPrint directly from your cell phone&mdash; supports iPhone and other mobile devices5Individual ink cartridges&mdash; replace only the color you needProfessional looking CDs/DVDs&mdash; print right onto ink jet printable CDs/DVDs without labelsEasily charge portable devices&mdash; free up a power outlet; charge cell phones and MP3 players6Epson PreferredSMprogram&mdash; one-year warranty and free lifetime customer phone support8Packaging Specifications (W x D x H)&mdash; Dimensions: Printing 18.3&quot; x 25.8&quot; x 7.8&quot;, Storage 18.3&quot; x 18.0&quot; x 7.8&quot; and Weight 24.9 lb.Eco featuresENERGY STAR&reg;qualifiedDesigned to be Recycled11Save up to 50% of your paper supply with automatic, two-sided printingEstimated power consumption for one year is less than two dollars10Save even more by printing multiple pages on a single sheetPC-Fax eliminates the need to print before sending a fax7Supports printing on recycled paperEpson America, Inc. is a SmarWaySMTransport Partner12Epson Ink Supplies98 Claria Black ink cartridge High-capacity (T098120)98 Claria Color Multi-Pack ink cartridges High-capacity (T098920)99 Claria Cyan ink cartridge Standard-capacity (T099220)99 Claria Magenta ink cartridge Standard-capacity (T099320)99 Claria Yellow ink cartridge Standard-capacity (T099420)99 Claria Light Cyan ink cartridge Standard-capacity (T099520)99 Claria Light Magenta ink cartridge Standard-capacity (T099620)99 Claria Color Multi-Pack ink cartridges Standard-capacity (T099920)Epson Paper SuppliesPremium Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 50 sheets (S041257)Bright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586)Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331)Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)What&rsquo;s in the BoxArtisan 835 Ink Jet All-in-OneSetup and instruction manualsCD-ROM with drivers and creativity softwarePower cord & Telephone CordFree sample paper packSix Claria Hi-Definition Ink cartridges (one 98 High-capacity Black ink cartridge and five 99 Standard-capacity color ink cartridges: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Light Cyan, Light Magenta)&dagger;What is ISO ppm?ISO ppm is based on the new international standard for measuring print speed.

        "title": "TeleZapper TZ 900",
        "description": "When you've had your dinner interrupted by a telemarketer one too many times, treat your phone line and yourself to the Telezapper TZ 900. It's a simple, one-time-cost solution to the problem of annoying telemarketing calls. Based on the enormously popular classic Telezapper, the newer Telezapper TZ 900 offers the advantages of a slimmer profile, built-in battery power, and an advanced three-tone mode.Here's how it works: Given that more than 90 percent of telemarketing calls are placed with computer assistance, when either you or your answering machine answers the phone, the Telezapper emits a special tone that tells the computer your number has been permanently disconnected. Telemarketing companies that use automated dialing systems typically remove disconnected numbers from their calling lists, and as your phone number is eliminated from more and more telemarketing lists, you'll notice fewer calls. Of course, not all telemarketers use predictive dialing systems, and those that do will undoubtedly continue their work to evade the Telezapper, but it can be a partial solution.Most predictive dialing systems will be fooled by the Telezapper's standard single tone. However, for newer dialing systems (presumably designed in response to the success of the previous Telezapper model), the TZ 900 offers an advance three-tone mode. To change the mode, unscrew and remove the protective case and then slide a recessed switch. (We suggest that Privacy Technologies put the switch on the outside for their next model.)For the most part, regular callers are unaffected by the Telezapper, but it may \"zap\" calls from other organizations that use the same predictive dialing technology (such as charities, pollsters, and automated emergency weather systems) and from callers who use certain types of calling cards. (For more information, click FAQ, or frequently asked questions, in the left navigation bar.)Installation takes seconds. Just plug the Telezapper into your phone line and your phone into the Telezapper. It's that simple. A built-in lithium-ion battery provides power and will likely last for the lifetime of the unit. The Telezapper includes a phone cord and instructions. Privacy Technologies backs the device with a one-year warranty.--Mike BrownProsReduces telemarketing calls placed by predictive dialing systemsDoesn't interfere with most normal callsInexpensive, one-time-cost solutionExtremely easy to install and useConsMay \"zap\" some desired callsAnnoying beep every time the receiver is lifted",

Nothing has changed since its introduction--it still uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), is easy and versatile in programming, and has a thin, sturdy casing. Certainly, there's been newer, fancier calculators introduced since, but there's something to be said for the quality of classics.The HP 12C's functions include all the basics--such as calculating APR, NPV, and IRR--and statistics are a snap. For students new to financial calculators, this is an excellent place to start. For the most part, the manual reads like a minitextbook, walking you through sample problems and situations followed by graphs and tables demonstrating the technique--and you can even check your results. The section on creating programs does seem to be written for the technically ignorant, addressing in detail how you could possibly benefit from using programs, but it'll still help you get the job done.In general, it's a bit slower than newer models, just like last year's computer isn't as speedy as today's new release. On the plus side, it's just 3 by 5 inches and slips easily into a pocket. The bottom is printed with a few little cheat notes for common functions, which is nice for quick reference. The HP 12C's one-year warranty and available tech-support line offer reassurance this little workhorse will continue to be an industry standard for years to come.--Jill LightnerPros:Pocket sizeThorough and simple instruction manualCompetitive priceCons:Calculates more slowly than modern machinesWhat's in the BoxCalculator, user's manual, installed batteries and carrying case",

But where the R2880 really excels is in the grayscale reproduction of black-and-white prints.  Three levels of black pigments and a special Black-and-White Photo Mode eliminate all of the unfortunate color casting that occurs in black-and-white prints from lesser photo printers... The R2880 is the artist's choice.

In order to take advantage of this feature, you will need to install at least one Ooma Scout device in a standard phone jack.Placing calls using the Instant Second LineTo make a call when somebody else in your house is on the phone, simply pick up a phone connected to a different Ooma device and you will hear the signature Ooma dialtone. If you are on the first line and want to make a second call, simply press the other line button (the light should be off) or press the flash key on your phone. You should hear the signature dialtone on the new line, indicating that the Instant Second Line is available.Answering calls on the Instant Second LineIf a second call comes in when somebody else in your house is on the phone, you will hear the call-waiting signal and all the other phones in the house will ring. If you are already on the phone, you can press the other line button (it should be blinking rapidly) or press the flash key on your phone. If someone else in the house wants to answer the call, they simply need to pick up a ringing phone connected to a different Ooma device.Alternating between phone linesTo alternate between two lines, simply press down on the line button of the call you wish to join (it should be blinking red) and the current call will automatically be placed on hold. Alternatively, press the flash key on your phone to alternate between phone lines.Placing calls on holdTo place a call on hold, simply press the button for the line you are on (the light should be solid red). Please note that if both lines are in use, you cannot place both calls on hold.Three-way conferencingYou can initiate a three-way conference call in a number of ways. Once you have two parties on the line, simply press down both lines at once on any Ooma device, and voila! You&rsquo;ve got yourself a three-way! Please note that if you hang up the phone during a conference call, both lines will be disconnected. Alternatively, you can break the three-way into two separate calls by pressing on either line button on an Ooma device. This will automatically place the other call on hold.Using the Instant Second Line using a cordless phoneIf you wish to make or take a second call when someone else is on the phone, simply pick up a phone connected to a different Ooma device and you will automatically get a new Ooma dialtone . You can also join the call in progress by pressing the flash key on your phone.",

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the &quot;MPG&quot; ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.Features/BenefitsSave time&mdash; world&rsquo;s fastest all-in-one in its class1with ISO print speeds of 15 ISO ppm (black) and 5.4 ISO ppm (color)&dagger;Easy wireless printing&mdash; connect to your wireless network in seconds with Easy Epson Wi-Fi2Get more done&mdash; 30-page Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or faxPC-Fax6&mdash; fax documents directly from your computerHigh-speed faxing&mdash; as fast as 3 sec per page; speed dial storage up to 60 numbers; fax memory up to 180 pagesProtect important documents&mdash; smudge, fade and water resistant prints; documents rival those from a laser printerSave energy&mdash; uses up to 70% less power than laser printers5Save paper&mdash; save up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two-sided printing4Print twice as much&mdash; get about 2x more prints with two Black cartridges3Individual ink cartridges&mdash; replace only the color you needProduct protection you can count on&mdash; one-year limited warranty; phone support, without charge, for the life of the product7; plus, access to business templates, tutorials and offersPackaging Specifications (W x D x H)&mdash; Dimensions: Printing 18.1&quot; x 21.3&quot; x 11.9&quot;, Storage 18.1&quot; x 15.9&quot; x 9.3&quot; and Weight 16.3 lb.WHAT'S IN THE BOXWorkForce 520 All-in-OneInstruction manualCD-ROM with drivers and bonus softwarePower cordTelephone cord5 DURABrite Ultra Ink cartridges:two 125-series Standard-capacity Black ink cartridgethree 125-series Standard-capacity color ink cartridges: Cyan, Magenta, YellowEPSON SUPPLIES126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Black ink cartridge (T126120)126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Cyan ink cartridge (T126220)126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Magenta ink cartridge (T126320)126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Yellow ink cartridge (T126420)126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Color Multipack (CMY) (T126520)Premium Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 50 sheets (S041257)Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331)Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)Eco featuresUses up to 70% less power than laser printers5Save up to 50% on paper with manual, two-sided printing4ENERGY STAR&reg;qualifiedDesigned to be Recycled8Epson America, Inc. is a SmarWaySMTransport Partner9&dagger;What is ISO ppm?ISO ppm is based on the new international standard for measuring print speed.

While it is limited by its capacity to work with only eight digits, this calculator should be adequate for simple mathematical duties. Push the LS-85H beyond it numerical limit, and an overflow function returns an error message and freezes the keyboard.Measuring a little less than 4 by 5.25 inches and boasting a large, upright display, the LS-85H is easy to use, and is easy to read in well-lit rooms. Powered by a solar cell, the LS-85H also contains an alkaline battery which allows the unit to be used under most lighting conditions. Battery life is dependent upon usage, though once the alkaline battery is discharged the calculator can still be used on solar power. A new battery can only be installed at a Canon Service Center. To help conserve battery power, the unit automatically turns itself off if it is not used for eight minutes. A tap on the N/C key turns it back on.--Luis Uzeta",

This replacement ink cartridge is made in the USA from new and recycled components. It is neither sponsored nor endorsed by Brother. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.By utilizing the remanufactured version of this ink, you are reducing the amount of waste being deposited into landfills. Instead of using a newly manufactured ink cartridge, by simply purchasing this remanufactured version, you are participating in the highest form of recycling: reuse. While not every component within the ink cartridge can be reused, we do ensure the best used and new components are obtained to deliver value and quality.Environmental stewardship is an important practice, and our goal is to re-use as many of the components as possible without degrading product performance. When the cartridges are no longer remanufacturable, or components no longer adhere to our quality specifications, the components will be disposed. For example, the metals will be stripped from the cartridge body and sent to a local recycler, the plastics are sent for conversion to waste energy, and corrugate box materials are locally recycled. We also use electro-coagulation to treat manufacturing waste water, use degradable black bags to protect sensitive cartridge components during shipping, and our facility recycles cans, bottles and paper products.STMC--Certified for Quality and ValueOur manufacturer's dedication to developing and following documented practices has earned them STMC (Standardized Test Methods Committee) certification for their testing practices.The quality control of the remanufacturing process begins before any cartridge is brought onto the production line. Experienced engineers develop specific quality processes for each cartridge type. The operators who are reviewing the cartridges are trained on not just the equipment they operate, but on the processes and procedures required to produce a quality, value cartridge.First, each cartridge is cleaned and inspected to determine whether it meets the quality requirements for remanufacturing. Once a cartridge has been approved for remanufacturing, the process begins with a thorough cleaning procedure to remove waste ink, and, if needed, replace various components. As the cartridge passes through each stage of the remanufacturing process, it is tested to confirm that the cartridge functions correctly.A postage-paid recycle-return bag is included with your new remanufactured cartridge so you can return your empty cartridge for recycling.AmazonBasics: Quality Products at Low PricesAmazonBasics is a collection of consumer electronic \"basics\" created by combining quality and low prices for an overall focus on value.Amazon Frustration-Free PackagingThis AmazonBasics product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging that is recyclable.

The packaging is designed to be opened without the use of a box cutter or knife, and it will protect your product just as well as traditional packaging. Products with Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging can frequently be shipped in their own boxes, without an additional shipping box, saving on resources and reducing waste.

Scan bills, receipts, reports and more. It&rsquo;s the perfect way to easily save electronic files of all your everyday documents.Text Enhancement with Auto Area Segmentation (AAS)Through this feature, text document scans are sharpened, thereby enhancing text recognition. In addition, all background data is removed from the scan, making it easier than ever to achieve clear scans from double&ndash;sided documents that have &quot;bleed&ndash;through&quot; from images or text printed on the reverse side. Auto Area Segmentation is a function that allows the scanner to segment a scanned document, identifying all text as &quot;text areas&quot; and all images as &quot;image areas&quot;. Text areas are scanned in black&ndash;and&ndash;white, while image areas are scanned in half&ndash;tone. This offers the best scanning mode for all elements, and ensures that all text and image data is preserved simultaneously.Color EnhanceWith Color Enhance, users can select and enhance a color from the RGB color channel, even when scanning in black&ndash;and&ndash;white. This can help bring out a particular element that might not otherwise show up clearly in a black&ndash;and&ndash;white scan, such as a signature made with a light&ndash;blue pen.Color DropoutColor Dropout allows users to remove a color from the RGB color channel &mdash; a color that might cause noise or other image issues during a document scan. For example, a user scanning an invoice printed on pink paper could use &quot;Color Dropout: Red&quot; to ignore all red elements and pull out the crisp black text.Event ManagerEpson Event Manager allows you to configure jobs so they can be initiated with one touch, making the Epson Perfection V500 Office easy and convenient.
